These skeletons are noticeably different from those in milestone2. We now have Icon Bar on the bottom of each page. Goal1 includes a new feature to will open camera and take a picture. The Goal Overview Page includes some pins on the map. We also have Login Page where user need to enter nickname and password. Also, the Rewards Page includes progress barto show the progress toward the next prize. Overall, all pages are more organized.
